# STX Next Playwright Testing Template

The project to have something akin of an STX Next starter for Playwright 
testing started a few weeks ago with two collaborators. We were working in a 
different Github repository and are now in a the process of migration.

We want to gather your feedback instead of just pushing our `main` to this repository.

The next steps are the following:

- We are going to create a PR with all the changes from the old repository
- After the review is over, we will merge all the changes to the 'main' branch
- And then we will continue improving the project

Your feedback is very welcome!
